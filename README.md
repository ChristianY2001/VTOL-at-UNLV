# VTOL at UNLV
Objective is to design a quiet and efficient VTOL for urban operations.

## Tasks
### Build prototype VTOL
* Using Heewing T01 base.
* Pixhawk flight controller. We are having issues with fitting this fight controller in the prototype.
* The plan is to swap over to a smaller Mateksys flight controller.
* Using PX4 as the flight controller firmware
### Set up this git hub page to be used by other collaborators.
### Set up public website (see Github pages).
### Reach out to interest students
We need to find students who are motivated to learn.
A project like this provides lots of valuable experience to students.
Could we set up some workshops to attract and train students?
How will we be marketing those workshops?
Will we require prerequisites? Applications?
Who do we approve?
### Crowd funding campaign
* Make marketing material

## Subsystems?

### CAD - 3D printing and design
Many custom parts need to be manufactured for this project.
The scope is broad.
Simple parts include enclosures and mounting plates for electronics;
however, the much more complex parts are required as well.
Examples of complex structures:
* Tilt-motor mechanism
* Wing connectors

### Flight dynamics and optimization
This is related to designing an optimal airframe.
CFD analysis

### UAS Electronics package
This includes learning how to connect motors and servos to a flight controller.
May require workshops to give students hands-on experience.

### Composites manufacturing
Fiberglass and carbon fiber to build the prototypes.

### Project Maintenance
Manage Github collaboration and deployment.
This project will be made open for anybody in the public to pull from.
