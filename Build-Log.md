# Heewing T01 Ranger VTOL (Kakute H7 mini) Build Log
The Heewing T01 Ranger is a twin motor RC plane that comes as plug and play kit out of the box. The following document 
goes over the additional steps required to convert the standard plane into a fully functioning VTOL.
## Key information
The Heewing VTOL kit does come with all of the required materials needed to have a sufficient VTOL (minus a flight controller and reciever), however, this
build log goes over all of the materials we are using in our current build which includes upgraded motors and ESC's.

The [assembly guide](https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0553/6573/0348/files/T1_PNP_Assembly_Guide.pdf?v=1640164559) released by Heewing
should be used to get throught the initial setup of the plane. Additionally, the VTOL conversion kit would require installing new higher powered motors,
a rear motor, and tilt servos. Heewing has released instructional videos on how to acomplish this.
